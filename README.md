## 23 Final Project : MERN Stack Single-Page Application

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This project is to build an application encouraging the users to stay active, enjoy the fresh air and sunshine found on the top of the mountain. Skiing is an excellent way to burn a ton of calories while getting in some great runs and feeling healthier. The application will be created as a MERN stack single-page application in which the users will be able to browse through the different ski packages and add the package or remove the package before checkout. Stripe payment platform will be used for the users to pay for the package. Contact Form will be used for the users to contact MERN Ski Resort Team in case of cancellation due to unforeseen circumstances or other enquiries.

The URL of the GitHub repository is https://github.com/stellalph/MERN-Ski-Resort.git and the repository name is MERN-Ski-Resort.

The URL of the deployed application is https://still-harbor-63486.herokuapp.com/

## Technologies Used

- The MERN stack has a three-layer architecture based on Model-View-Controller pattern and each interconnected layer performs a specific function in the application and this application is a MERN stack application which is a group of four technologies:-

  - React JS for the front end, that is, the client (View) in which the user inputs data and the data display,
  - GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server for the method called to store and retrieve data,
  - MongoDB and Mongoose ODM for the database (Model) to store raw data and contains no logic.

- The folder and file structure is set according to MVC pattern as below screenshot:-

- An example of the testing using GraphQL playground at http://localhost:3001/graphql

- This application also uses sensitive API key information on the server - JWT, MONGODB_URI and Stripe Secret Key has loaded onto .ENV file has been loaded for the protection. Emailjs 's template ID, Service ID and User ID has also relocated to .ENV file on the client's side.

## Deployment

- This application has been deployed to Heroku with MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas and below is an example of MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas (products and purchase history):-

  - Products/Package

  - Purchase on 21/08

- Click here for the deployed application on [Heroku](https://still-harbor-63486.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

Below are the screenshots of the walkthrough steps in which the user will able to browse through the different packages.

- When the user load onto the website, the user would be able to see the landing page, the navbar with the name of the resort, the login, register, about, the cart for checkout, welcome message from the resort and a number of ski packages selection.
